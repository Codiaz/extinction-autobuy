# Extinction Autobuy
 This is a piece of concept which i used to use on the server "Extinction".
 This allows you to buy items automatically from the market.

## Installation
( You need NODEJS ) 
```bash
    npm i express axios chalk
    node express.js
```

## Requirements
 You will need the following : 
 ```
 - Fast France Proxies (https://webshare.io)
 - FiveM Canaray Mode.
 ```

 ## Reason of me releasing this
I am now banned of GLife Extinction and this is my reason for releasing this repository. I feel like this is very dumb but people wanted to pay me for that, which i dont feel okay with. It's a game afterall.


## Usage 
Run the express server ( node express.js )
Just join GLife Extinction and open the NUI DEVTOOLS ( f8 -> nui_devtools )
And type the script (script.js)
